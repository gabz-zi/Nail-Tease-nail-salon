#  The project

Hey, 👉You👈! Gotcha!💥 Are you still running from unnecessary phone calls?! Here we click them away!🧐 "Nail Tease" is a webiste for making online appointments and all that without a single vocal cord in your throat trembling!

## Installation

To start the project introduce your Environment variables for the DB: db_password and db_username and for the admin user: APP_ADMIN_USERNAME and APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD. With all that excitement going on don't forget that the main nailSalon project should run simultaneously with the nailSalon-designs project. (Yes, indeed a special one it is.🥴)

After you've logged in you may take a look at the available services, if you're not too eager to fill in your board like that guy:

You can still cancel anytime without having to go full mode cold war on with your nail artist! :)

Of course you have to catch the nail(👁️) of the admin to get that role. ;)

But you needn't worry, I am sure the admin will see you are the coolest guy.
The admin could also reject applications but that is not what we attract here! Their giving hand gets into a fist when an employee tries to ruin the client paradise this app is by rejecting appointments here and there so they can track who is banned and fire them.
